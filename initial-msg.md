Hi! I'm continuing work on my PDF Form Filler Next.js application. 

The project is deployed at: https://github.com/shopallsoftware02/pdf-filler-v1

KEY CONTEXT:
- ✅ Session persistence is FIXED - no more data loss on refresh
- ✅ PDF files, form data, and categories all save to localStorage  
- ✅ Field organization with category reordering is working
- ✅ All major UI/UX improvements completed

Please read PROJECT_INFO.md for complete technical details and CHANGELOG.md for recent improvements.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19 and TypeScript
- 82 files successfully deployed to GitHub
- All features working: PDF upload, field detection, form filling, data persistence
- Ready for next phase of development

What should we work on next?
